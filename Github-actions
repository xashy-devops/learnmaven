some gits commands: 
 we can use git checkout commitid 

 that would move commits to another branch 

you can do a git checkout main to go back to your full histroy. 

git revert: "used to undo a commit"

we can make use of git revert : it takes a look at the commit and creates a new commit that undoes that commit. 

git revert  "commit id"

it keeps the history of the commits and does't delete.

git reset hard "commitid"

git branches : This is the most important aspect of commits and it would server as an area where u can make ur feature changes without impacting your main code. 

Branches would make u not to interfer with other commits. 

git branch branchname --->> would create a branch 

git checkout -b would create a branch and checkout to it. 

git branch -D would delete the branch. you have to make sure you are not in the branch. 

working locally with git is not good because collegues wont see what you are doing.

if somwthing happens to your code you wont be able to access it. 

git checkout -b branchname would create the branch and checout to it. 

you can use a use a git pull to pull changes from the remote that doesnt exist on the local. 

WHAT IS A PULL REQUEST: A request compares your your commit and and the current repository. 

it request others to pull changes to the main branch. It request to review our code and the changes to the code. 
we can then have people change what we have.
